This README documents the 'lib' directory in the autosetup source repository.

*.tcl files in this directory are optional modules which
can be loaded with the 'use' directive.

Files named *.auto are auto-load modules.

Modules which are publicly documented (those that contain @synopsis: ...), and auto-load modules are installed
stand-alone in a local autosetup installation to facilitate understanding by autosetup
end-users.

All other modules are private/internal and are combined with the
main autosetup script when installed.

A system-installed version of autosetup (--sysinstall) contains all modules.
